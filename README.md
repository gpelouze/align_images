# Align images

Collection of tools to align series of images containing the same subject, such
as astronomical data. :milky_way:

## Installation

Clone the repository (or download the sources), and install with pip:

~~~
git clone https://github.com/gpelouze/align_images
cd align_images
pip install .
~~~


## Usage

### Align a series of images

The alignment is done using two different functions in `align`:

- `align.compute_shifts()` returns the spatial shift for all images in the
  series. The shifts are determined by searching for the maximum of the 2D
  cross-correlation of these these images, relatively to either a reference
  image, or to all other image in the series.
- `align.align_cube()` builds a new series of aligned images using the output
  of `compute_shifts()`. Input images are interpolated to build the aligned
  ones.

The slowest steps of both functions (*ie.* the determination cross-correlation
maximum location and the interpolations) can to be parallelised by using the
keyword `processes`.

The function `align.roll_cube()` is provided as a faster but much less accurate
alternative to `align.align_cube()`. Make sure to understand its limitations
before using it!

See the functions documentation for more informations.

**Example**

~~~python
from astropy.io import fits
from align_images import align, tools

cube = fits.open('data.fits')[0].data
shifts = align.compute_shifts(cube, ref_frame=cube[0])
aligned_cube = align.align_cube(cube, shifts, processes=4)
tools.save_fits_cube(aligned_cube, 'aligned_data.fits')
~~~

### Determine the shift between two images

The shift between two images is determined computing their 2D
cross-correlation (CC), and finding the location its maximum. This is performed by
`align.track()`, which calls the appropriate function from `cc2d`, depending on
the required method.

Currently, 3 methods are provided by `cc2d` for computing the (CC), each
implementing different boundary conditions:

- `explicit()`: multiplication in the real space.
- `dft()`: multiplication in the real Fourier space.
- `scipy()`: a wrapper around `scipy.signal.correlate2d`.

While `explicit(boundary='drop')` is far less sensitive to edge effects than
`dft()`, it is also much slower. If a full CC map is not required,
`explicit_minimize()` can instead be used to locate the CC maximum within a
reasonable computation time.

**Normalization**

For any method, let `img1` and `img2` the entry images. We first subtract their
respective averages:  
*I* = `img1` - avg(`img1`),  
*J* = `img2` - avg(`img2`).

Then compute the normalisation factor, which is the product of the standard
deviations of *I* and *J*:  
*norm* = σ(*I*) × σ(*J*) = sqrt(sum(*I²*) × sum(*J²*)).

The cross-correlation returned by the method is normalized by this factor, such
that its maximum is 1:  
*cc = I ⋆ J / norm*.


### Miscellaneous tools

The submodule `tools` contains various functions either required by `align` and
`cc2d`, or that can be used to manipulate the images before they are aligned.
